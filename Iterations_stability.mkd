## Stability 

We consider iterations mapping $\mathbb{R}$ on itself, that is: $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

The cobweb construction makes it reasonably intuitive that the stability of a fixed point is linked to the first-order derivative of $f$

More specifically, we prove:

\bt{Stability of hyperbolic fixed points}
Let $p$ a hyperbolic fixed point of $f$.

 - $p$ is a _sink_ if $|f^\prime(p)|<1$, 
 - $p$ is a _source_ if $|f^\prime(p)|>1$. 

\et

We first proceed by proving that for any $\epsilon>0$, there is $\delta >0$ such that

\begin{displaymath}
|f^\prime (p)| - \varepsilon < \left| \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}\right| < |f^\prime (p)| + \epsilon. 
\end{displaymath}

This relationship emerges from the definition the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the fixed point. Indeed, from:

\begin{displaymath}
f^\prime (p) = \lim_{x\rightarrow p} \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} = \lim_{x\rightarrow p} \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}, 
\end{displaymath}

we find, by definition of the limit:

\begin{displaymath}
|x-p|<\delta, x\neq p \rightarrow \left| f^\prime (p) - \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}\right| < \epsilon. 
\end{displaymath}

As $|x+y|<|x|+|y|$, we find the sought after relationship. 

Now, we consider separately the attractor and the sink. 

If $|f^\prime (p) |<1$, we can find $\epsilon$ and the corresponding $\delta$ such that $|f^\prime(p)| < 1-\epsilon$ and:

\begin{displaymath}
|f(x) -  (p)| < (|f^\prime(x)| + \epsilon) |x-p|  < \delta.
\end{displaymath}

We proceed by successive iterations, i.e., substituting $f(x)$ to $x$ in the above relationship to find:


\begin{displaymath}
|f^n(x) -  (p)| < (|f^\prime(x)| + \varepsilon)^n |x-p|  < \delta, 
\end{displaymath}

and this $\forall n>0$. We have proved the attractor property. There is a $\delta$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|f^n(x)-p|=0$. 

Now, we consider the source case, and proceed by contradiction. We now that we can find  $\epsilon >0$ such
that $(|f^\prime(x)|-\epsilon >1$. There is also a $\delta$ such that, for $|x-p|<\delta$, 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:t12}
|f(x) -  (p)| > (|f^\prime(x)| + \varepsilon) |x-p|. 
\end{equation}

If there was one $x\neq p$, such that  $|f^n(x) -  (p)| < \delta Â \forall n \geq 1$, we would get, by iteration of \eqref{eq:t12}: 


\begin{displaymath}
|f^n(x) -  (p)| > (|f^\prime(x)| + \varepsilon)^n |x-p|. 
\end{displaymath}


but as $(|f^\prime(x)| + \varepsilon)>1$ I can find a $n$ such that, given $|x-p|$, the right-hand-side as big as I want, which contradicts the hypothesis. \hfill$\square$.
