## Stability of iterations

We consider iterations mapping $\mathbb{R}$ on itself, that is: $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

The cobweb construction makes it reasonably intuitive that the stability of a fixed point is linked to the first-order derivative of $f$

More specifically, we prove:

\bt{Stability of hyperbolic fixed points}
Let $p$ a hyperbolic fixed point of $f$.

 - $p$ is a _sink_ if $|f^\prime(p)|<1$, 
 - $p$ is a _source_ if $|f^\prime(p)|>1$. 

\et

We first proceed by proving that for any $\epsilon>0$, there is $\delta >0$ such that, for $|x-p|<\delta$:

\begin{displaymath}
|f^\prime (p)| - \varepsilon < \left| \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}\right| < |f^\prime (p)| + \epsilon. 
\end{displaymath}

This relationship emerges from the definition the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the fixed point. Indeed, from:

\begin{displaymath}
f^\prime (p) = \lim_{x\rightarrow p} \frac{f(x)-f(p)}{x-p} = \lim_{x\rightarrow p} \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}, 
\end{displaymath}

we find, by definition of the limit that, for any $\epsilon$ we can find a $\delta$ such that:
 $\left| f^\prime (p) - \frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}\right| < \epsilon$. 

It comes up that the distance between $|f^\prime (p)|$ and $|\frac{f(x)-p}{x-p}|$ is less that $\epsilon$. 

Now, we consider separately the attractor and the sink. 

If $|f^\prime (p) |<1$, we can find $\epsilon$ and the corresponding $\delta$ such that $|f^\prime(p)| < 1-\epsilon$ and:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:it1}
|f(x) -  p| < (|f^\prime(p)| + \epsilon) |x-p|  < \delta.
\end{equation}

We proceed by successive iterations. Indeed, we now know that the point $f(x)$ is also close to $p$, with a distance less than $\delta$. Hence, the above relationship also applies to this point, i.e., 
we may substituting $f(x)$ to $x$, to find:

\begin{displaymath}
|f(f(x)) -  p| < (|f^\prime(p)| + \epsilon) |f(x)-p|  < \delta
\end{displaymath}

and then substitute the result of \eqref{eq:it1}. Iteration after iteration we eventually find

\begin{displaymath}
|f^n(x) -  (p)| < (|f^\prime(x)| + \varepsilon)^n |x-p|  < \delta, 
\end{displaymath}

and this  $\forall n>0$. This is exactly the attractor property. There is a $\delta$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|f^n(x)-p|=0$. 

Now, we consider the source case. We know that we can find  $\epsilon >0$ such
that $|f^\prime(x)|-\epsilon >1$. There is also a $\delta$ such that, for $|x-p|<\delta$, 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:t12}
|f(x) -  p| > (|f^\prime(p)| + \varepsilon) |x-p|,
\end{equation}

By iteration of \eqref{eq:t12}: 

\begin{displaymath}
|f^n(x) -  (p)| > (|f^\prime(p)| + \varepsilon)^n |x-p|. 
\end{displaymath}

As $(|f^\prime(p)| + \varepsilon)>1$ I can find a $n$ such that, given $|x-p|$, the right-hand-side as big as I want. I have therefore found a $\delta$ such that $|f^n(x) -  p| > \delta Â \forall n \geq 1$. \hfill$\square$.

## Linearised system

If $f(x)$ is $C^\infty$, we can also proceed by Taylor expansion, writing, around a fixed point $p$, if $x_n=p+\xi_n$,

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
p+\xi_{n+1} = f(p+\xi_n) &= f(p)+f^\prime(p)\xi_n + \frac{1}{2}f^{\prime\prime}(p)\xi_n^2 + \mathcal{O}(x_n^3) \\
                     &= p   +f^\prime(p)\xi_n + \frac{1}{2}f^{\prime\prime}(p)\xi_n^2 + \mathcal{O}(x_n^3) \\
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}

Hence, 
\begin{displaymath}
\xi_{n+1} = f^\prime(p)\xi_n + \frac{1}{2}f^{\prime\prime}(p)\xi_n^2 + \mathcal{O}(x_n^3) 
\end{displaymath}

From this it is clear around a _hyperbolic_ fixed point, the linearised system evolves, near the fixed point, as a geometric convergence towards the fixed point if $|f^\prime (p)| < 1$, and geometric for $|f^\prime (p)| > 1$:

\begin{displaymath}
\xi_{n} \sim  f^\prime(p)^n xi_0
\end{displaymath}


A bit abusively, we sometimes speak of exponential divergence or convergence but cleary what we have here is a power law. It dictates the behaviour of the system in a neighbourhood of a non-hyperbolic fixed point as long as $f^\prime(p)$ is non-zero. 

The particular case  $|f^\prime (p)| = 0$ merits some mention. The fixed point is said to be _superstable_. The second-order approximation is $$\xi_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}f^{\prime\prime}(p)\xi_n^2.$$ 


The convergence (we have convergence since  $|f^\prime (p)| < 0$)  is supergeometric:

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
\xi_{n} &\simeq \frac{1}{2} f^{\prime\prime}(p) \xi_{n-1}^2 \\
       &\simeq \frac{1}{2}  \frac{1}{2}^2 f^{\prime\prime}(p) f^{\prime\prime}(p)^2  \xi_{n-2}^4 \\
       &\simeq \left(\frac{1}{2} f^{\prime\prime}(p) \right)^{1+2+\ldots+n}   \xi_{0}^{2n} \\
       &\simeq \left(\frac{1}{2} f^{\prime\prime}(p) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}(n)(n+1)}   \xi_{0}^{2n} \\
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}


\bd{superstable point}
A point with  $f^{\prime}(p)=0$  is said to be superstable. 
\ed

It may be shown that the root found by a Newton-Raphson iteration is superstable. 

Quite naturally, the stability of $k-$periodic orbit may be assessed considering the iteration $f^k$ and its derivatives.

## Analysis of the logistic equation

We come back to the logistic iteration $f(x)=rx(1-x)$,and examine some of its properties:

### Diverging orbits outside $[0,1]$ for $r>1$. 

For $r>1$, orbits are diverging towards $-\infty$ for $x_0 \notin [0,1]$. We proceed separately for $x_0<0$ and $x_0>1$. 

For $x_0<0$, the definition of the iteration makes it clear that $x_{n+1} < x_{n}$ (tip: write it as $rx-rx^2$), and there cannot be any fixed point $p$ towards which the iteration converges. Indeed, this would imply

\begin{displaymath}
p = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} x_{n+1} =\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) = f (\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} x_n) = f(p) < p.
\end{displaymath}

If $x_0>1$, then $f(x_0)$ is negative, and we are back to case one. 

### Fixed points 

The fixed points satisfy $p=f(p)=rp(1-p)$. The two roots are $p=0$ and $p=1-\frac{1}{r}$. The second root $p=1-\frac{1}{r}$ exists even for $r<1$ but it is negative, and unstable. 

Inspection of the derivative shows that:

- $p=0$ is a sink for $r<1$ and a source for $r>1$ (assuming $r$ positive);
- $p=1-\frac{1}{r}$ is a hyperbolic sink for $1<r<3$ and a source for $r>3$. 


The paramater $r=1$ corresponds to a _transcritical_ bifurcation, where both fixed points exchange their stability. Above $r>3$, both fixed points become unstable, so that we have another kind of bifurcation that is now investigated. 

### Existence of 2-periodic points for $r>3$. 

The existence of a 2-periodic point is conditioned by the equation

\begin{displaymath}
rp(1-p)(1-rp(1-p)) = p.
\end{displaymath}

Having the $p$ of the right-hand-side in the left-hand-side and some algebra genie would show that this is equivalent to

\begin{displaymath}
rp(p-(1-\frac{1}{r}))(r^2p^2 - r(r+1)p + r + 1) = 0.
\end{displaymath}

This form has the merit to make it clear that we have a fixed point for $p=0$ and $p=1-\frac{1}{r}$ but these are the fixed points of the iteration (period 1) so they can't count as a solution for period-2 orbits. The period-2 points are hidden in the third factor. There must be 2 roots, which are real for $r>3$, and which correspond to the $2$ distinct points ($p_1$ and $p_2$) that form the orbit. 

Further analysis shows that the $2-$orbit is attracting for $3<r<1+\sqrt{6}$, and repulsive for $r>1+\sqrt{6}$. This requires inspection of $(f^2)^\prime=f^\prime(p_2)f^\prime(p_1)$. 

In summary, we have a _period doubling_ bifurcation at $r=3$ and we anticipate a similar phenomenon at $1+\sqrt{6}$. At the specific parameter of $r=3$, the orbit is  converging _very slowly_ towards the $\frac{2}{3}$. 

Numerical inspection of fixed points shows a suit of bifurcations at (rounded numbers) $r_1=3, r_2=3.44949$, $r_3=3.54409$ converging towards $r_\infty = 3.56994$, with geometric convergence of the increments: 

\begin{displaymath}
\delta = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left( \frac{r_n-r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1}-r_n} \right) = 4.66920
\end{displaymath}

This is called the Feigenbaum number, who observed it in other iterations (e.g. $f(x)=r\sin(\pi x)$), suggesting it be a universal property. 

### Chaotic behaviour for $r_\infty < r < 4$

In this regime, the orbits have mostly  the characteristics of chaos that we further define in section \label{sect:chaos}. Numerical analysis shows however some suprising windows of peridic behaviour (look again at the orbit diagram in section \ref{sect:lgrowth}, and of _intermittent_ behaviour, where the system seems to hesitate between different periods. 

### Fractal set of diverging orbits  for $r>4$

The maximum of $rx(1-x)$ occurs at $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and is $r/4$. Hence, for $r>4$ there is an interval $A$ comprised between $x\mp = \frac{1}{2} ( 1 \mp \sqrt {1-\frac{4}{r}})$ that ejects the points out of the safe interval $[0,1]$, from where trajectories diverge towards $-\infty$. 

However, outside $A$, there are also smaller intervals that will drive $x$ into $A$, so that their positive orbits also diverge.  This reasoning leads us to the construction of an ensemble of diverging orbits that is a Cantor set, made of the union of disjoint sets that have a self-similarity property.
