We now consider the autonomous dynamical system on the line, with parameter $\psi$ which, for simplicity, we view as one-dimensional. 

## Monotonous character of the trajectories

\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff1d}
\ddt x = f(x;\psi),\text{ with }x \in \mathbb{R},Â \psi \in \mathbb{R},
\end{equation}
with $f$ continuous and differentiable over $x$ and $\psi$. 

We start with a remarkable properties of the trajectories:

\bt{No local extrema.} Trajectories of \eqref{eq:diff1d} do not have local maxima and minima. \et

Proof: If there was a local extrema at time $t$, $x(t)$ at that point would need to have a zero-derivative, it must therefore be a fixed point; thus the trajectory must be constant and it cannot have local extrema. \hfill$\square$

It comes up that trajectories on the line must either be constant (fixed point), strictly increasing (towards infinity, or towards a fixed point), or strictly decreasing (ditto). 

## Stability of the fixed point
 
\bd{Hyperbolic fixed points on the line}
Fixed points on the line are said to be hyperbolic if the derivative $\od{f}{x}$ is either strictly negative or positive
\ed 

\bt{Stability of hyperbolic fixed points on the line}
Fixed points with $\od{f}{x}|_{x=x_f} < 0$, or $\od{f}{x}|_{x=x_f} > 0$, are asymptotically stable or unstable, respectively \et

Consider $x_f$ a fixed point, so that by definition $f(x_f)=0$. Suppose first that $\od{f}{x}|_{x=x_f}$ is strictly negative. Then it comes that there one can find a (small) open neighbourhood around $x_f$ such that $f(x)$ is strictly positive for $x<x_f$ in this neighbourhood, and $f(x)$ is strictly negative for $x<x_f$. It comes up that orbits in this neighbourhood will asymptotically converge (since they are monotonous) to $x_f$. One can also verify that the conditions for Lyapunov stability are fulfilled. There is thus asymptotic stability.

By the same token, one verifies asymptotic _instability_ when $\od{f}{x}|_{x=x_f}>0$. \eop


Hyperbolic fixed points with negative derivative are a _sink_; those with positve derivative are a _source_. 

Stability is no-longer trivial for non-hyperbolic fixed points, since one cannot affirm that $\od{f}{x}$ changes sign. We show an example below. 

\bcd
Consider again the motivating example with the ice sheets. Are the fixed points hyperbolic? Everywhere ? (tip: it is enough  to restrict the discussion to the case $x \neq 0$. )

## The saddle-node bifurcation

We now consider changes in $\psi$ that may affect the existence or the _nature_ of the fixed point. To this end, consider the following example: $f(x;\psi) = \psi - x - e^{-x}$. 

The fixed point may be visualised graphically, with the equation $e^{-x} = \psi - x$. This is the _phase portrait_. 


\input{Figures/phaseprotrait.eepic}

As is clear from the figure showing the phase portraits, the number of fixed points changes for 2 hyperbolic fixed points for $\psi >1$, to one non-hyperbolic fixed point at $\psi = 1$, to zero for $\psi < 1$. Hence, the parameter $\psi = 1$ marks a change in the topology of the flow. This is a singularity that is called a _bifurcation point_. 

In this section we will learn to _detect_ bifurcation points in vector fields on the line and classify them. 

To this end, let us continue with the example with have just started. The bifurcation occurs at $\psi=1$ and we would like to study the behaviour of $f$ near this bifurcation point. 

To this end, we develop the function according to Taylor (recall that we have taken care of its differentiability):

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
f(x;\psi) =& 
f(x_0;\psi_0) + 
\left.\pd{f}{\psi}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (\psi - \psi_0) + 
\left.\pd{f}{x}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (x - x_0) + \\
& \frac{1}{2} \left.\pd[2]{f}{x}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (x-x_0)^2 + \\
& \frac{1}{2} \left.\pd[2]{f}{\psi}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (\psi-\psi_0)^2 + \\
& \left.\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \psi\partial x}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (x-x_0)(\psi-\psi_0)  \\
& + \ldots \\
=& \underbrace{\psi - 1 - \frac{1}{2} x^2}_{\text{normal form}} + \ldots
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}

Hence, if we develop the vector field around the bifurcation point, it takes a specific form that depends on the first and second-order derivatives on $x$ and $\psi$. This specific form is called a _normal form_, and the normal form characterises the bifurcation. 

Specifically, the normal form $f(x;\psi^\prime)=\psi^\prime - \frac{1}{2} x^2$ ($\psi^\prime := \psi-1$) is characteristic of the _saddle-node_ bifurcation (also called a _fold bifurcation_): it is the collision of a stable and an unstable fixed point, with both vanishing beyond the bifurcation point. We have met this exact bifurcation in the motivating example. 

\bt{Sufficient conditions for a  saddle-node bifurcation on the line.} A saddle-node bifurcation occurs on $x_0,\psi_0$ when:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1. $f(x_0;\psi_0) = 0$; &
3. $\pd[2]{f}{x}(x_0;\psi_0) \neq 0$;
\\
2. $\pd{f}{x}(x_0;\psi_0) = 0$; &
4. $\pd{f}{\psi}(x_0;\psi_0) \neq 0$;
\end{tabular}
\et

The intuition beyond this theorem is reasonably clear. The first condition imposes the existence of the fixed point; the second one is the non-hyperbolic character of the fixed point (neither linear stable nor linearly unstable). The third and fourth conditions set the locally parabolic character of the solutions near the bifurcation point. 

More formally, from the implicit function theorem, (1) and (4) imply that there must exist a function $\psi(x)$ on an interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x,\psi(x)) = 0$ and $\psi(x_0)=\psi_0$.

This is the curve of fixed points, as a function of $\psi$. Furthermore, its derivatives are:


\begin{displaymath}
\od{\psi}{x} = - \frac {\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{x}}{\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{\psi}};
\end{displaymath}


The assumptions (1) and (4) imply that $\od{\psi}{x}=0$.  And

\begin{displaymath}
\od[2]{\psi}{x} = - 
\frac {
\pd[2]{f(x, \psi(x))}{x} \pd{f\left(x; \psi\left(x\right)\right)}{\psi} + 
\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{x} \frac{\partial f(x; \psi(x))}{\partial \psi \partial x} }{ \left( \pd{f\left(x;\psi\left(x\right)\right)}{\psi}\right)^2}, 
\end{displaymath}

which then must be different from zero from (3) and (4). 
Both indicate that the solution curve $\psi(x)$ has a minimum or a local maximum in $x=x_0$ and therefore must bear the characteristic of a saddle-node bifurcation, as shown on the following graph:

## Summary of the bifurcations on the line
 - saddle node: two fixed points collapsing and annihilating each other
 - trans-critical: two fixed points exchanging stability
 - fork : one fixed point losing stability, sending trajectories towards two adjacent fixed points.
