We now consider the autonomous dynamical system on the line, with parametre $\psi$ which, for simplicity, we view as one-dimensional. 

## Monotonous character of the trajectories

\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff1d}
\ddt x = f(x;\psi),\text{ with }x \in \mathbb{R},Â \psi \in \mathbb{R},
\end{equation}
with $f$ continuous and differentiable over $x$ and $\psi$. 

We start with a remarkable proporties of the trajectories:

\bt{No local extrema.} Trajectories of \eqref{eq:diff1d} do not have local maxima and minima. \et

Proof: If there was a local extremum at time $t$, $x(t)$ at that point would need to have a zero-derivative, it must therefore be a fixed point; thus the trajectory must be constant and it cannot have local extrema. \hfill$\square$

It comes up that trajectories on the line must either be constant (fixed point), strictly increasing (towards infinity, or towards a fixed point), or strictly decreasing (ditto). 

## The saddle-node bifurcation

We now consider changes in $\psi$ that may affect the existence or the _nature_ of the fixed point. To this end, consider the following example: $f(x;\psi) = e^{-x} - x + \psi$. 

The fixed point may be visalised graphically, with the equation $e^{-x} = x-\psi$.

As is clear from the figure, the number of fixed points changes for 2 hyperbolic fixed points for $\psi >1$, to one non-hyperbolic fixed point at $\psi = 1$, to zero for $\psi < 1$. Hence, the parameter $\psi = 1$ marks a change in the topology of the flow. This is a singularity that is called a _bifurcation point_. 

In this section we will learn to _detect_ bifurcation points in vector fields on the line and classify them. 

To this end, let us continue with the example with have just started. The bifurcation occurs at $\psi=1$ and we would like to study the behaviour of $f$ near this bifurcation point. 

To this end, we develop the function according to Taylor (recall that we have taken care of its differentiablity):

\begin{displaymath}
\begin{split}
f(x;\psi) =& 
f(x_0;\psi_0) + 
\left.\pd{f}{\psi}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (\psi - \psi_0) + 
\left.\pd{f}{x}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (x - x_0) + \\
& \frac{1}{2} \left.\pd[2]{f}{x}\right|_{x_0,\psi_0} (x-x_0)^2 + \ldots \\
=& \underbrace{\psi - 1 - \frac{1}{2} x^2}_{\text{normal form}} + \ldots
\end{split}
\end{displaymath}

What we have found here, is that if we develop the vector field around the bifurcation point, we find that, to the second order, it takes a specific form that depends on the first and second-order derivatives on $x$ and $\psi$. This specific form is called a _normal form_, and the normal form characterises the bifurcation. 

Specifically, the normal form $f(x,\psi)=\psi - 1 - \frac{1}{2} x^2$ is characteristic of the _saddle-node_ bifrucation: it is the collision of a stable and an unstable fixed point, with both vanishing beyond the bifurcation point. We have met this exact bifurcation in the motivating example. 

\bt{Sufficient conditions for a  saddle-node bifurcation on the line.} A saddle-node bifurcation occurs on $x_0,\psi_0$ when:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1. $f(x_0;\psi_0) = 0$; &
3. $\pd[2]{f}{x}(x_0;\psi_0) \neq 0$;
\\
2. $\pd{f}{\psi}(x_0;\psi_0) = 0$; &
4. $\pd{f}{\psi}(x_0;\psi_0) \neq 0$;
\end{tabular}
\et

The intuition beyond this theorem is reasonably clear. The first condition imposes the existence of the fixed point; the second one is the non-asymptotic character of the fixed point (neither linear stable nor linearly unstable). The third and fourth condition set the locally parabolic character of the solutions near the bifurcation point. 

More formally, from the implicit function theorem, (1) and (4) imply that there must exist a function $\psi(x)$ on an interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x,\psi(x)) = 0$ and $\psi(x_0)=\psi_0$.

This is the curve of fixed points, as a function of $\psi$. Furthermore, its derviatives are:


\begin{displaymath}
\od{\psi}{x} = - \frac {\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{x}}{\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{\psi}};
\end{displaymath}


The assumptions (1) and (4) imply that $\od{\psi}{x}=0$.  And

\begin{displaymath}
\od[2]{\psi}{x} = - 
\frac {
\pd[2]{f(x, \psi(x))}{x} \pd{f\left(x; \psi\left(x\right)\right)}{\psi} + 
\pd{f(x, \psi(x))}{x} \frac{\partial f(x; \psi(x))}{\partial \psi \partial x} }{ \left( \pd{f\left(x;\psi\left(x\right)\right)}{\psi}\right)^2}, 
\end{displaymath}

which then must be different from zero from (3) and (4). 
Both indicate that the solution curve $\psi(x)$ has a minimum or a local maximum in $x=x_0$ and therefore must bear the characteristic of a saddle-node bifurcation, as shown on the following graph:

## Summary of the bifurcations on the line
 - saddle node: two fixed points collapsing and annihilating each other
 - trans-critical: two fixed points exchanging stability
 - fork : one fixed point losing stability, sending trajectories towards two adjacent fixed points.
