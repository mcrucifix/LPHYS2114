Exercises will be evaluated and provide a _fifth_ of the final evaluation that can no longer be modified. There will be a _written_ exam (June and September sessions) that is focused on exercises. Exams of the previous years are available on Moodle. They will be focused on applications, knowledge of the theory being instrumental in solving the problems.
