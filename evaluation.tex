Exercises will be evaluated and provide a third of the final evaluation
that can no longer be modified. There will be a \emph{written} exam
(June and September sessions) that is focused on exercises. Exams of the
previous years are available on Moodle. They will be focused on
applications, knowledge of the theory being instrumental in solving the
problems.
