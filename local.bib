 abstract = {{This book introduces the full range of activity in the rapidly growing field of nonlinear dynamics. Using a step-by-step introduction to dynamics and geometry in state space as the central focus of understanding nonlinear dynamics, this book includes a thorough treatment of both differential equation models and iterated map models (including a detailed derivation of the famous Feigenbaum numbers). It includes the increasingly important field of pattern formation and a survey of the controversial question of quantum chaos. Important tools such as Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, and correlation dimensions are treated in detail. Several appendices provide a detailed derivation of the Lorenz model from the Navier-Stokes equation, a summary of bifurcation theory, and some simple computer programs to study nonlinear dynamics. Each chapter includes an extensive, annotated bibliography.}},

 abstract = {Abstract Glacial--interglacial cycles are large variations in continental ice mass and greenhouse gases, which have dominated climate variability over the Quaternary. The dominant periodicity of the cycles is Ôê╝ 40 kyr before the so-called middle Pleistocene transition between Ôê╝ 1.2 and Ôê╝ 0.7 Myr ago, and it is Ôê╝ 100 kyr after the transition. In this paper, the dynamics of glacial--interglacial cycles are investigated using a phase oscillator model forced by the time-varying incoming solar radiation (insolation). We analyze the bifurcations of the system and show that strange nonchaotic attractors appear through nonsmooth saddle--node bifurcations of tori. The bifurcation analysis indicates that mode-locking is likely to occur for the 41 kyr glacial cycles but not likely for the 100 kyr glacial cycles. The sequence of mode-locked 41 kyr cycles is robust to small parameter changes. However, the sequence of 100 kyr glacial cycles can be sensitive to parameter changes when the system has a strange nonchaotic attractor.},

 abstract = {The analysis of univariate or multivariate time series provides crucial information to describe, understand, and predict climatic variability. The discovery and implementation of a number of novel methods for extracting useful information from time series has recently revitalized this classical field of study. Considerable progress has also been made in interpreting the information so obtained in terms of dynamical systems theory. In this review we describe the connections between time series analysis and nonlinear dynamics, discuss signal-to-noise enhancement, and present some of the novel methods for spectral analysis. The various steps, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, are illustrated by their application to an important climatic time series, the Southern Oscillation Index. This index captures major features of interannual climate variability and is used extensively in its prediction. Regional and global sea surface temperature data sets are used to illustrate multivariate spectral methods. Open questions and further prospects conclude the review.},
